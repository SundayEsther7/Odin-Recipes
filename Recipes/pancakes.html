        <h4>Descreption</h4>
        <p>The blueberries in these whole wheat pancakes are so sweet and moist that they don't even need butter when eaten while hot! This is our Saturday breakfast, healthy for me; yummy for husband and kids.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <il>1 ¼ cups whole wheat flour</il>
            <il>2 teaspoons baking powder</il>
            <il>1 egg</il> 
            <il>1 cup milk, plus more if necessary</il>
            <il>½ teaspoon salt</il>
            <il>1 tablespoon artificial sweetener</il>
            <il>½ cup blueberries</il>
        </ul>
        <h3>teps</h3>
        <ol>
            <il>Sift together flour and baking powder, set aside.</il>
            <il> Beat together the egg, milk, salt and artificial sweetener in a bowl and stir.</il>
            <il> Stir in flour until just moistened, add blueberries, and stir to incorporate.
            <il>Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, and spray with cooking spray.</il>
            <il>Pour approximately 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan for each pancake.</il>
            <il> Cook until bubbly, about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn, and continue cooking until golden brown.</il>
        </ol>
        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>You may need to use more milk than 1 cup. The batter should be thin enough so that it pours, but not so thin that it's runny. We find that 1/4 cup additional milk is about the maximum needed.</p>
