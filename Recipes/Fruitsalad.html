    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion.</p>
    <p>There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it.</p>
    <p> This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices.</p>
    <p> I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p>
